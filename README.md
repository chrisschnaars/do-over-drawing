# Do Over Drawing

Stop worrying and start drawing.

## Development notes
- Built using [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) and [p5js](https://p5js.org/)
- Spin up your own build:
  - run `npm install`
  - start the dev server: `npm run dev`
  - visit [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)

## What is this?
It's an interactive art experiment made by Chris Schnaars. Beyond that, I'm not sure? Is it a game? A creative exercise? A frustrating user experience for those seeking artistic permanence? I'll let you be the judge.

## Tricks
-   Holding down the left-mouse button is the equivalent to picking up your crayon
-   Press the spacebar to pause the timer (you also will pause drawing)
