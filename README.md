# Do Over Drawing

Stop worrying and start drawing.

### What is this?

It's an interactive art experiment made by Chris Schnaars. Beyond that, I'm not sure? Is it a game? A creative exercise? A frustrating user experience for those seeking artistic permanence? I'll let you be the judge.

### Tricks

-   Holding down the left-mouse button is the equivalent to picking up your crayon
-   Press the spacebar to pause the timer (you also will pause drawing)
